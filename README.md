<p align="center"><b>Minimal WebGL framework.</b></p>

<br />

⚠️ *Note: currently in alpha, so expect breaking changes.*

[See Examples](https://oframe.github.io/ogl/examples)

O-GL is a small, effective WebGL framework aimed at developers who like minimal layers of abstraction, and are comfortable creating their own shaders.

With zero dependencies, the API shares many similarities with ThreeJS, however it is tightly coupled with WebGL and comes with much fewer features.

In its design, the framework does the minimum abstraction necessary, so devs should still feel comfortable using it in conjunction with native WebGL commands.

Keeping the level of abstraction low helps to make the framework easier to understand and extend, and also makes it more practical as a WebGL learning resource.

## Install

[Download](https://github.com/oframe/ogl/archive/master.zip) and [load directly in the browser](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/modules) using es6 modules - **no dev-stack required**.

**or**

```
npm i ogl
```

## Examples

## Weight

Even though the source is completely modular, as a guide, below are the complete component download sizes.

Component | Size (gzipped)
------------ | -------------:
Core | 6kb
Math | 7kb
Extras | 7kb
Total | 20kb

It's worth noting that it's very rare that one would use all, or even many, of the extras. For simple uses, not even all of the Core files would be used, so with tree-shaking (recommend Rollup), one can expect the final size to be much lighter than the values above.

## Usage

Importing can be done from two points of access for simplicity. These are `Core.js` and `Extras.js` - which relate to the component structure detailed below. *Note: this may cause some issues with certain bundlers when tree-shaking.*
If you are using npm modules and a dev build pipeline, then importing is done directly from the `index.js` for all components, so this can be ignored.

```js

import {Renderer, Camera, Transform, Program, Mesh} from './Core.js';
import {Box} from './Extras.js';
```

Below renders a spinning white cube.

```js

{
    const renderer = new Renderer({
        width: window.innerWidth,
        height: window.innerHeight,
    });
    const gl = renderer.gl;
    document.body.appendChild(gl.canvas);

    const camera = new Camera(gl, {
        fov: 35,
        aspect: gl.canvas.width / gl.canvas.height,
    });
    camera.position.z = 5;

    const scene = new Transform();

    const geometry = new Box(gl);

    const program = new Program(gl, {
        vertex: `
            attribute vec3 position;

            uniform mat4 modelViewMatrix;
            uniform mat4 projectionMatrix;

            void main() {
                gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
            }
            `,
        fragment: `
            void main() {
                gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0);
            }
        `,
    });

    const mesh = new Mesh(gl, {geometry, program});
    mesh.setParent(scene);

    requestAnimationFrame(update);
    function update(t) {
        requestAnimationFrame(update);

        mesh.rotation.y -= 0.04;
        mesh.rotation.x += 0.03;
        renderer.render({scene, camera});
    }
}
```

For a simpler use, such as a full-screen shader, more of the core can be omitted as a scene graph and projection matrices are unnecessary. 

```js
import {Renderer, Geometry, Program, Mesh} from './Core.js';

{
    const renderer = new Renderer({
        width: window.innerWidth,
        height: window.innerHeight,
    });
    const gl = renderer.gl;
    document.body.appendChild(gl.canvas);

    // Triangle that covers viewport, with UVs that still span 0 > 1 across viewport
    const geometry = new Geometry(gl, {
        position: {size: 2, data: new Float32Array([-1, -1, 3, -1, -1, 3])},
        uv: {size: 2, data: new Float32Array([0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2])},
    });

    const program = new Program(gl, {
        vertex: `
            attribute vec2 uv;
            attribute vec2 position;

            varying vec2 vUv;

            void main() {
                vUv = uv;
                gl_Position = vec4(position, 0, 1);
            }
        `,
        fragment: `
            precision highp float;

            uniform float uTime;

            varying vec2 vUv;

            void main() {
                gl_FragColor.rgb = vec3(0.8, 0.7, 1.0) + 0.3 * cos(vUv.xyx + uTime);
                gl_FragColor.a = 1.0;
            }
        `,
        uniforms: {
            uTime: {value: 0},
        },
    });

    const mesh = new Mesh(gl, {geometry, program});

    requestAnimationFrame(update);
    function update(t) {
        requestAnimationFrame(update);

        program.uniforms.uTime.value = t * 0.001;

        // Don't need a camera if camera uniforms aren't required
        renderer.render({scene: mesh});
    }
}
```

## Structure

In an attempt to keep things light and modular, the framework is split up into three components: **Math**, **Core**, and **Extras**.

The **Math** component is based on [gl-matrix](http://glmatrix.net/), however also includes classes that extend Array for each of the module types. This technique was shown to me by [@damienmortini](https://twitter.com/damienmortini), and it creates a very efficient, yet still highly practical way of dealing with Math. 7kb when gzipped, it has no dependencies and can be used separately.

The **Core** is made up of the following:
 - Geometry.js
 - Program.js
 - Renderer.js
 - Camera.js
 - Transform.js
 - Mesh.js
 - Texture.js
 - RenderTarget.js

Any additional layers of abstraction will be included as **Extras**, and not part of the core as to reduce bloat.

Below is an **Extras** wish-list, and is still a work-in-progress as examples are developed.
 - [x] Plane.js
 - [x] Box.js
 - [x] Sphere.js
 - [x] Cylinder.js
 - [x] Orbit.js
 - [x] Raycast.js
 - [x] Post.js
 - [x] Skin.js
 - [x] Animation.js
 - [x] Text.js
 - [ ] Curve.js
 - [x] Flowmap.js
 - [x] NormalProgram.js

## Examples wishlist

[Examples](https://oframe.github.io/ogl/examples)

In order to test the completeness of the framework, below is a wish-list that covers most commonly-used 3D techniques.

It is an opinionated, comprehensive list of examples for any fully-fledged WebGL framework.

Inspired by the effectiveness of ThreeJS' examples, they will serve as reference for how to achieve a wide range of techniques.

For more advanced techniques, extra classes will be developed and contained within the 'Extras' folder of the framework.
